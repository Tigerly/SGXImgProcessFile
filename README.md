Prerequisites:

- Ensure that you have the following required operating systems: 
  Ubuntu\* Desktop-14.04-LTS 64bits

- Install [Intel(R) SGX SDK for Linux* OS](https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx) and follow all the instructions;

```

Build the SgxImgProcessFile

The following steps describe how to build the SgxImgProcessFile application.

-  Build the project with the prepared Makefile: 


-  Hardware Mode, Debug build:
```
  $ make SGX_MODE=HW SGX_DEBUG=1
```

-  Hardware Mode, Pre-release build:
```
  $ make SGX_MODE=HW SGX_PRERELEASE=1
```

-  Hardware Mode, Release build:
```
  $ make SGX_MODE=HW
```

-  Simulation Mode, Debug build:
```
  $ make SGX_DEBUG=1
```

-  Simulation Mode, Pre-release build:
```
   $ make SGX_PRERELEASE=1
```

-  Simulation Mode, Release build:
```
   $ make
``` 

- To clean the files generated by previous `make` command, enter the following command: 
```
  $ make clean
```

Run the SgxImgProcessFile
-------------------------

To Rotate Image in 180 degree, enter the following command:
